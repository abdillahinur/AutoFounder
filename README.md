# AutoFounder

AutoFounder is a browser-based web application that helps founders go from idea to investor inbox in 60 seconds. It generates AI-powered pitch decks and enables instant download as PowerPoint (.pptx) filesâ€”no backend required. All generation and export logic runs client-side for privacy and speed.

## Tech Stack

AutoFounder is built with a modern, production-ready stack:

- **React** & **TypeScript**: For building robust, type-safe user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool for React projects.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **pptxgenjs**: PowerPoint (.pptx) export of pitch decks, fully in-browser.
- **framer-motion**: Animations and transitions for UI components.
- **lucide-react**: Icon library for modern React apps.
- **clsx**: Utility for conditionally joining classNames.
- **uuid**: For generating unique project and tracking IDs.

### (Legacy/Optional)
- **Zod**: TypeScript-first schema validation for form and API data.
- **Stripe**: Payment processing for unlocking premium features.
- **Resend**: Transactional email delivery for investor outreach.
- **html2pdf.js**: Client-side PDF export of pitch decks.

The app is designed for hackathon speed: local/in-memory storage, no backend, and all templates are custom Tailwind layouts. All images for slide backgrounds are stored in `/public/images/` and can be easily swapped for different deck themes.

## How It Works

- User fills out a multi-step form (see `src/components/DeckFormModal.tsx`).
- Form data is mapped to a JSON slide template (`lib/deckTemplates.ts`).
- On submit, `utils/generatePitchDeckPPTX.ts` generates a PowerPoint deck in the browser using pptxgenjs, only rendering fields that exist in both the template and user input.
- The deck is downloaded instantly with custom backgrounds from `/public/images/`.
- No backend/API calls are made; all logic is client-side.

## Customizing Deck Templates & Backgrounds

- To add or edit slide templates, update `lib/deckTemplates.ts`.
- To change slide backgrounds, add images to `/public/images/` and update the paths in `utils/generatePitchDeckPPTX.ts`.
